## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nikita, and I'm 18 years old. I'm pursuing a Computer Science degree at [INRTU](https://istu.edu). I love programming and have been doing it since 5th grade. 

Here are some fun facts about me:

 - ðŸŒ± I'm always trying new things; it's my lifestyle.
 - ðŸ‘¯ I enjoy participating in hackathons and other programming events â€” theyâ€™re so exciting!
 - ðŸŽ¬ I dream of becoming a movie director someday.
